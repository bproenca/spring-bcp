/*
In any messaging-based application, there are message publishers and messaging receivers. To create the message receiver.

The Receiver is a simple POJO that defines a method for receiving messages.
As youâ€™ll see when you register the Receiver as a message listener,
you can name the message-handling method whatever you want.

For demonstration purposes, it is autowired by its constructor with a countdown latch.
That way, it can signal when it has received a message
