/*
Triggering a restart

As DevTools monitors classpath resources, the only way to trigger a restart is to update the classpath.
The way in which you cause the classpath to be updated depends on the IDE that you are using. In Eclipse,
saving a modified file will cause the classpath to be updated and trigger a restart.
In IntelliJ IDEA, building the project (Build â†’ Make Project) will have the same effect.
