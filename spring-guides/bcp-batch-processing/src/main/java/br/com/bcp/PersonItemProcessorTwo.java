/*
A common paradigm in batch processing is to ingest data, transform it, and then pipe it out somewhere else.
Here you write a simple transformer that converts the names to uppercase.

PersonItemProcessor implements Spring Batch’s ItemProcessor interface.
This makes it easy to wire the code into a batch job that you define further down in this guide.
According to the interface, you receive an incoming Person object, after which you transform it to an upper-cased Person.

There is no requirement that the input and output types be the same.
In fact, after one source of data is read, sometimes the application’s data flow needs a different data type.
